# About #
This project was born out of both my need for an issue tracker and my wanting to learn PHP. The Red Tiger Bug Assassin is written entirely in PHP and will attempt to bring users an easy to understand interface for tracking the development of their software. When RTBAssassin is to an acceptable point, I will use it for issue tracking instead of Google's standard issue tracker.

# Status #
Pre-Alpha - RTBAssassin is not in a testable let alone usable state. Stay tuned for the announcement of an expected release date.
